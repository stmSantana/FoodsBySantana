# FoodsBySantana
This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description
Currently, version 1.0 only adds the following food items to the game:
- ![Cup noodles](images/ico_GearItem__CupNoodles+1.png  "Cup noodles") Cup Ramen

### Finding Items
Currently the new item will be spawned while searching various locations, that should contain food or drink items, e.g. kitchen cupboards, back packs.
I have also added spawns for all items in various locations. Some of those are guaranteed, others are randomized.

### Adding Food Items
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) CupRamen can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add cupnoodles`.
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.
