## Description v1.2
<img src="images/Foods-v1.2.jpg" width="50%"><BR>
Currently, version 1.2 only adds the following food items to the game:
- ![Cup noodles](images/ico_GearItem__CupNoodles+1.png  "Cup noodles") ![Cup noodles Cooked](images/ico_GearItem__CupNoodlesOpen+1.png  "Cup noodles cooked") Cup Ramen (`add cupnoodles`)
- ![Summit Ramen](images/ico_GearItem__SoyRamen+1.png  "Summit Ramen") ![Summit Ramen Cooked](images/ico_GearItem__SoyRamenCooked+1.png  "Summit Ramen cooked") Summit Ramen (`add soyramen`)

### Finding Items
Currently the new item will be spawned while searching various locations, that should contain food or drink items, e.g. kitchen cupboards, back packs.
I have also added spawns for all items in various locations. Some of those are guaranteed, others are randomized.

### Adding Food Items
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) CupRamen can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add cupnoodles`.
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.
